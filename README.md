# RC-Car-Motors

This project was my final project in my Intro to Engineering course. I wanted to program a RC-Car built from scratch so that it would take input from the keyboard to control the 
motors so the vehicle could move. This was my first time handling a project this big involving arduino software and hardware. Needless to say, after I got all 
the bells and whistles figured out, it was a blast! It took a lot of debugging and finding those really annoying small errors in my code, but then I finally 
proced a product I was satisfied with. I also built the car by myself as well, but i'm not going in depth on how much of a hassle that was:)
